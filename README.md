# Redux/Sagas MovieList

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Project_

I made an app that could render movies from a database to the dom. If you want more details on a certain movie you can click on it, it will send you to a new page and display information about that specific movie. I solved this using redux, sagas, and some tricky sql.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Postico 2
- Postgres
- Github

## Installation
1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage
How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

1. You look through the movies on the first page, and decide which movie to press.
2. Click a movie you want more information about
3. A detail page shows up, and tells you a description, shows you the poster, and show the genres of that movie
